  "Unit 2": {
    "Algorithm": {
      "Definition": "A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. It has a beginning, a sequence of instructions, and an end.",
      "Example": "To add two numbers → Step 1: Input A, B → Step 2: Add A+B → Step 3: Show result",
      "Characteristics": [
        "Finite: Must complete after limited steps",
        "Definite: Each step should be clear (no confusion)",
        "Input: Takes zero or more inputs",
        "Output: Produces at least one result",
        "Effective: Every step must be simple and doable"
      ],
      "Advantages": [
        "Easy to understand and stepwise representation of problem",
        "Helps in finding errors easily",
        "Works as a blueprint before making program"
      ],
      "Disadvantages": [
        "Writing takes more time and effort",
        "Complex problems make algorithms very long",
        "No standard way of representation"
      ],
      "Examples": {
        "Find Largest of Two Numbers": [
          "Step 1: Input A, B",
          "Step 2: If A > B → Print A else Print B",
          "Step 3: Stop"
        ],
        "Find Sum of First 3 Numbers": [
          "Step 1: Input A, B, C",
          "Step 2: SUM = A + B + C",
          "Step 3: Print SUM",
          "Step 4: Stop"

    "Flowchart": {
      "Definition": "A flowchart is a diagram that shows steps of a process using symbols and arrows. It helps to understand the flow of logic in solving a problem.",

        "Oval": "Start / End of process",
        "Rectangle": "Process or instruction (e.g., calculation)",
        "Diamond": "Decision / condition (Yes-No, True-False)",
        "Parallelogram": "Input / Output (read, print)",
        "Arrow": "Shows direction of flow"
      },
      "Advantages": [
        "Easy to understand logic through visual diagrams",
        "Helps in debugging and analyzing processes",
        "Useful for documentation and communication between programmers"
      ],
      "Disadvantages": [
        "Complex programs make very large flowcharts",
        "Difficult to modify once drawn",
        "Time-consuming to design in detail"
